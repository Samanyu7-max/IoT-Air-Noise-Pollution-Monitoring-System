# IoT-Air-Noise-Pollution-Monitoring-System
1. Problem Statement
Air pollution and noise pollution are major environmental concerns affecting public health, productivity, and overall quality of life. Traditional monitoring systems are expensive, stationary, and not easily accessible for real-time analysis.
The goal of this project is to develop an IoT-based Air and Noise Pollution Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi Pico that can measure key environmental parameters in real time and transmit this data to a cloud dashboard for remote monitoring.
The system should emphasize:
Accuracy in measurement
Cost-effectiveness using affordable sensors
Ease of deployment
Real-time data accessibility through an IoT dashboard
This solution will help communities, institutions, and industries to monitor pollution levels and take timely corrective actions.
2. Scope of the Solution
The project will include:
Development of a sensor-based monitoring system using Raspberry Pi Pico
Measurement of air quality parameters such as particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), gas levels (CO, CO₂, NH₃, etc., depending on sensor used)
Measurement of noise levels using a microphone or sound sensor
Data acquisition from sensors and processing using Raspberry Pi Pico
Real-time wireless data transmission to an IoT cloud platform (e.g., Blynk, ThingSpeak, Firebase, or MQTT server)
Cloud-based data visualization dashboard showing live and historical data
Generation of analytics charts, such as trends and thresholds
Portable, low-cost, and user-friendly design suitable for urban and indoor monitoring
A working demo video explaining setup, operation, and analytics
The project will result in a fully functional IoT-based environmental monitoring system with
