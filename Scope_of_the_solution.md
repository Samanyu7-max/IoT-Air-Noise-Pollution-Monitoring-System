# Scope of the solution

1.Includes:

Hardware design and bill of materials for one sensor node.

Firmware (MicroPython) for Raspberry Pi Pico W to read sensors and publish via MQTT/HTTP.

Instructions to host data on cloud IoT platform (Adafruit IO, ThingsBoard, or ThingSpeak) and configure a dashboard.

Data visualization and analytics examples (time series, rolling averages, thresholds, simple alerts).

Short demo video outline showing device operation and dashboard.

2.Not included:

Full multi-node mesh management (but MQTT topics support multi-node).

Regulatory-grade calibration (guidance and basic calibration steps provided).
